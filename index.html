          What really makes Texas State unique is the people who work here.
          Texas State University seeks candidates whose professional background
          includes embracing a diversity of people and ideas, a spirit of
          inclusiveness, a global perspective, and a commitment to
          community-building. As a federally designated Hispanic Serving
          Institution, we are especially interested in applicants who share a
          commitment to equity, and the high-quality education of students from
          historically underserved and systematically marginalized communities.
          Individuals from historically underrepresented groups are strongly
          encouraged to apply.

        One is an important number at Texas State. There are thousands of us,
        but we’re united by one shared purpose: to make a positive impact in our
        world. More than 38,000 undergraduate and graduate students choose from
        more than 200 bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs — from
        biology to music to business to geography and more. And each student
        finds the personalized support and opportunities they need to succeed
        beyond the classroom. One is never a lonely number at Texas State,
        because each one of us has thousands of Bobcats guiding and inspiring us
        on the way.
